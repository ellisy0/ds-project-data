## Usage of AI tools in the project

We used ChatGPT and Bing AI for topic exploration. They are almost complete useless and could only come up with some generic, boring topics.

We used GitHub Copilot for image labelling. It interestingly saves some time for the boring, repetitive labelling work, since it has some knowledge of paintings by Turner and Monet and could infer labels from painting titles with some accuracy.
