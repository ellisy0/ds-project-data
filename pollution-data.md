# Climate Data

## One-dimensional SO2 levels

From year 1750 to 1900, in London and Paris. Data approximation by R. M. Hoesly et al., “Historical (1750–2014) anthropogenic emissions of reactive gases and aerosols from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS)”

Limitation: Completely ignores the impact from particular matters released by burning coals. (Though in the paper they have some justifications for this choice)

## Historical coal data

[Coal production, availability and consumption 1853 to 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption)

Strength: High confidence in the accuracy of the data (raw data)

Limitation: Low data density, only one data point every 10 years from 1853 to 1903. No data before 1853. Only mining output & employment data.

## Hisorical energy consumption in the UK

Since most of the SO2 emmision (reasoned in the original paper as the primary source of visible atmospheric pollution) comes from burning coal, and 19th century energy production mostly exclusively comes from coal. W. S. Humphrey and J. Stanislaw, “Economic growth and energy consumption in the UK, 1700–1975”

Strength: Covers 1800-1900; covers all types of energy consumption, not just electricity, hence the practive of burning of coal from all industries.

Limitation: Low data density, only one data point every 10 years.

## Suspended Particular Matter (SPM) in London, UK, and France

from Fouquet and DPCC (2011) and Ritchie (2016) (https://ourworldindata.org/london-air-pollution)

Strength: this is a more direct metric to indicate air pollution levels. There’s a data point every year. CSV file.
